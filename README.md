# Market Environment Report

Automated daily market environment analysis and email reporting. The script fetches the CNN Fear & Greed Index, VIX, and major ETF prices, computes technical indicators (e.g., RSI), classifies the current regime, renders a trend chart, and emails an HTML report on a daily schedule. [[13]]
